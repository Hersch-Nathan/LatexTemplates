\section{Introduction}

This is a test document to verify that the \texttt{designreport.cls} class file works correctly after removing the impact statement environment.

\section{Test Section}

This section contains some basic content to test the formatting:

\subsection{Subsection Test}

This is a subsection with some text content.

\subsubsection{Subsubsection Test}

This is a subsubsection to test the formatting hierarchy.

\section{Engineering Requirements}

The following table demonstrates the longtable functionality for engineering requirements that can span multiple pages:

\begin{longtable}{|p{1cm}|p{4cm}|p{1cm}|p{4cm}|p{4cm}|}
\caption{Engineering Requirements Table} \label{tab:engineering-requirements} \\
\hline
\textbf{ER No.} & \textbf{Engineering Requirement} & \textbf{MR} & \textbf{Justification} & \textbf{Verification} \\
